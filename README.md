The idea for this project began when I wanted to learn SQL through hands-on practice. I started by building a simple program to experiment with database queries. After grasping the basics, I realized this could evolve into a real-world business tool—and that’s how NeatTouch Management Tool was born.

Neat Touch Cleaning, a small cleaning service in Red Deer County, became the perfect use case. After discussing their workflow challenges with the owners, I tailored the application to support their specific needs, turning a learning project into a practical solution.
